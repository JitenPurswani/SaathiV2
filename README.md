# Saathi: Your Digital Companion for a Calmer Home

This project is born from a desire to provide meaningful, practical support for a loved one experiencing memory challenges. It's more than just an app; it's a dedicated digital companion designed to ease the mental burden of managing daily household tasks, restoring a sense of calm and independence. The core mission is to create a seamless, intuitive tool that feels less like technology and more like a helpful partner in the home.

## Core Features

*   **Multilingual Voice-First Interface:** Designed for natural interaction, it allows users to add chores and reminders simply by speaking in their preferred language, such as Hindi or English (e.g., "Mujhe 2 kilo doodh lena hai").

*   **Intelligent Chore Management:** The system uses a powerful AI to understand conversational language, automatically identifying the task, relevant items, and any specified times. It then organizes these into a structured to-do list with automated reminders.

*   **Smart Pantry System:** The application intelligently tracks grocery items mentioned in chores. When a task like "buy 2 kgs of milk" is added, the virtual pantry is automatically updated, creating an always-current inventory of household supplies.

*   **AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions:** To help answer the daily question of "what to cook?", the assistant can generate creative and simple recipe ideas based on the ingredients currently available in the smart pantry, reducing decision fatigue and inspiring new meal options.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
*   **AI:** Ollama, Cerebras
*   **State Management:** React Context
*   **UI Components:** Lucide React
